Tapper-MessageReceiver

This project contains the message receiver of Tapper. This message
receiver is responsible for getting messages (especially about state
changes) from remote systems and put them into a database where the
Tapper MCP can find them. 

Developers note: Please keep this project small, well tested and as
stable as possible.the message receiver is the weak spot for a
persistent Tapper MCP and should therefore stay as strong as possible.
